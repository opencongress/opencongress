meaning of section 223 of the Internal Revenue 

Code of 1986) on the dollar value of benefits for any 

participant or beneficiary. 
 (B) PER BENEFICIARY LIMITS. Subsection (a) 
shall not be construed to prevent a group health plan or 
health insurance coverage that is not required to provide 
essential health benefits under section 1302(b) of the Patient 
Protection and Affordable Care Act from placing annual 
or lifetime per beneficiary limits on specific covered 
benefits to the extent that such limits are otherwise permitted 
under Federal or State law.</p>


<h3>SEC. 2712. PROHIBITION ON RESCISSIONS. </h3>

 <p>A group health plan and a health insurance issuer 
offering group or individual health insurance coverage 
shall not rescind such plan or coverage with respect to an 
enrollee once the enrollee is covered under such plan or 
coverage involved, except that this section shall not apply 
to a covered individual who has performed an act or practice that constitutes fraud or makes an intentional misrepresentation 
of material fact as prohibited by the terms 
of the plan or coverage. Such plan or coverage may not 
be cancelled except with prior notice to the enrollee, and 
only as permitted under section 2702(c) or 2742(b).</p>



<h3>SEC. 2713. COVERAGE OF PREVENTIVE HEALTH SERVICES. </h3>

 <p>(a) IN GENERAL. A group health plan and a health

of a child receiving dependent coverage. 
 (B) REGULATIONS. The Secretary shall promulgate 
regulations to define the dependents to which coverage 
shall be made available under subsection (a).

or coverage. In developing such standards, the Secretary 
shall consult with the National Association of Insurance 
Commissioners (referred to in this section as the NAIC), 
a working group composed of representatives of health in-
surance-related consumer advocacy organizations, health 
insurance issuers, health care professionals, patient advo

4 pages in length and does not include print smaller 
than 12-point font.</p>





<p>(2) LANGUAGE. The standards shall ensure 
that the summary is presented in a culturally and 
linguistically appropriate manner and utilizes terminology 
understandable by the average plan enrollee.</p> 


<p>(3) CONTENTS. The standards shall ensure 
that the summary of benefits and coverage includes  
 (A) uniform definitions of standard insurance 
terms and medical terms (consistent with subsection (g)) so that consumers may compare 
health insurance coverage and understand the 
terms of coverage (or exception to such coverage);  (B) a description of the coverage, including 
cost sharing for (i) each of the categories of the essential 
health benefits described in subparagraphs 
(A) through (J) of section 
1302(b)(1) of the Patient Protection and 
Affordable Care Act; and  (ii) other benefits, as identified by 
the Secretary; 
 (C) the exceptions, reductions, and limitations on coverage; (d)  the cost-sharing provisions, including

chronic medical conditions and related cost 
sharing, such scenarios to be based on recognized 
clinical practice guidelines; (g) a statement of whether the plan or 
coverage (i)  provides minimum essential coverage 
(as defined under section 5000A (f) 
of the Internal Revenue Code 1986); and  
(ii) ensures that the plan or coverage 
share of the total allowed costs of benefits 
provided under the plan or coverage is not 
less than 60 percent of such costs; (h) a statement that the outline is a 

summary of the policy or certificate and that 
the coverage document itself should be consulted 
to determine the governing contractual 
provisions; and  (I) a contact number for the consumer to 
call with additional questions and an Internet 
web address where a copy of the actual individual 
coverage policy or group certificate of 
coverage can be reviewed and obtained.  (C) PERIODIC REVIEW AND UPDATING. The Sec


retary shall periodically review and update, as appropriate, 

the standards developed under this section. (d)  REQUIREMENT TO PROVIDE.</p>



<p>(1) IN GENERAL. Not later than 24 months 
after the date of enactment of the Patient Protection 
and Affordable Care Act, each entity described in

pursuant to the standards developed by 
the Secretary under subsection (a) to  
 (A) an applicant at the time of application; 
 (B) an enrollee prior to the time of enrollment 
or reenrollment, as applicable; and  (C) a policyholder or certificate holder at 
the time of issuance of the policy or delivery of 
the certificate.</p>




<p>(2) COMPLIANCE. An entity described in 

paragraph (3) is deemed to be in compliance with 
this section if the summary of benefits and coverage 
described in subsection (a) is provided in paper or 
electronic form.</p>


<p>(3) ENTITIES IN GENERAL. An entity described 
in this paragraph is  

 (A) a health insurance issuer (including a 
group health plan that is not a self-insured 
plan) offering health insurance coverage within 
the United States; or (B) in the case of a self-insured group 
health plan, the plan sponsor or designated administrator 
of the plan (as such terms are defined 
in section 3 (16) of the Employee Retirement 
Income Security Act of 1974).</p>


<p>(4) NOTICE OF MODIFICATIONS. If a group 

health plan or health insurance issuer makes any 


material modification in any of the terms of the plan 
or coverage involved (as defined for purposes of section 
102 of the Employee Retirement Income Security 
Act of 1974) that is not reflected in the most 
recently provided summary of benefits and coverage, 
the plan or issuer shall provide notice of such modification 
to enrollees not later than 60 days prior to 
the date on which such modification will become effective.(e)PREEMPTION. The standards developed under 

subsection (a) shall preempt any related State standards 
that require a summary of benefits and coverage that provides 
less information to consumers than that required to 
be provided under this section, as determined by the Secretary.(f) FAILURE TO PROVIDE. An entity described in 
subsection (d) (3) that willfully fails to provide the information 
required under this section shall be subject to a 
fine of not more than $1,000 for each such failure. Such 
failure with respect to each enrollee shall constitute a separate 
offense for purposes of this subsection. (g) DEVELOPMENT OF STANDARD DEFINITIONS.</p>


<p>(1) IN GENERAL. The Secretary shall, by 
regulation, provide for the development of standards 
for the definitions of terms used in health insurance 
coverage, including the insurance-related terms described 
in paragraph (2) and the medical terms described 
in paragraph (3).</p>


<p>(2) INSURANCE-RELATED TERMS. The insurance-
related terms described in this paragraph are 
premium, deductible, co-insurance, co-payment, out-
of-pocket limit, preferred provider, non-preferred

<p>(3) MEDICAL TERMS. The medical terms described 
in this paragraph are hospitalization, hospital 
outpatient care, emergency room care, physician 
services, prescription drug coverage, durable 
medical equipment, home health care, skilled nursing 
care, rehabilitation services, hospice services, emergency 
medical transportation, and such other terms 
as the Secretary determines are important to define 
so that consumers may compare the medical benefits 
offered by health insurance and understand the extent 
of those medical benefits (or exceptions to those 
benefits). 
</p>

<h3>SEC. 2716. PROHIBITION OF DISCRIMINATION BASED ON SALARY. 
</h3><p>
 (A) IN GENERAL. The plan sponsor of a group 
health plan (other than a self-insured plan) may not establish 
rules relating to the health insurance coverage eligibility 
(including continued eligibility) of any full-time employee 
under the terms of the plan that are based on the 
total hourly or annual salary of the employee or otherwise 
establish eligibility rules that have the effect of discriminating 
in favor of higher wage employees. 

 (B) LIMITATION. Subsection (a) shall not be construed 
to prohibit a plan sponsor from establishing contribution 
requirements for enrollment in the plan or coverage 
that provide for the payment by employees with 
lower hourly or annual compensation of a lower dollar or 
percentage contribution than the payment required of 
similarly situated employees with a higher hourly or annual 
compensation. 

</p>
<h3>SEC. 2717. ENSURING THE QUALITY OF CARE. 
</h3>
<p>
 (A) QUALITY REPORTING.</p>


<p>(1) IN GENERAL. Not later than 2 years 
after the date of enactment of the Patient Protection 
and Affordable Care Act, the Secretary, in consultation 
with experts in health care quality and stakeholders, 
shall develop reporting requirements for use 
by a group health plan, and a health insurance 



issuer offering group or individual health insurance 

coverage, with respect to plan or coverage benefits 

and health care provider reimbursement structures 

that 

 
 (A) improve health outcomes through the 
implementation of activities such as quality reporting, 
effective case management, care coordination, 
chronic disease management, and medication 
and care compliance initiatives, including 
through the use of the medical homes model as 
defined for purposes of section 3602 of the Patient 
Protection and Affordable Care Act, for 
treatment or services under the plan or coverage; 
 (B) implement activities to prevent hospital 
readmissions through a comprehensive 
program for hospital discharge that includes patient-
centered education and counseling, comprehensive 
discharge planning, and post discharge 
reinforcement by an appropriate health 
care professional; 
 (C) implement activities to improve patient 
safety and reduce medical errors through 
the appropriate use of best clinical practices, 



evidence based medicine, and health information 
technology under the plan or coverage; and  (D) implement wellness and health promotion 
activities.</p>


<p>(2) REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.  

 (A) IN GENERAL. A group health plan 
and a health insurance issuer offering group or 
individual health insurance coverage shall annually 
submit to the Secretary, and to enrollees 
under the plan or coverage, a report on whether 
the benefits under the plan or coverage satisfy 
the elements described in subparagraphs 
(A) 
through  (d) of paragraph (1). 

(B) tIMING OF REPORTS. A report 
under subparagraph (A) shall be made available 
to an enrollee under the plan or coverage during 
each open enrollment period. 

 (C) AVAILABILITY OF REPORTS. The 
Secretary shall make reports submitted under 
subparagraph (A) available to the public 
through an Internet website (d)  PENALTIES. In developing the reporting 
requirements under paragraph (1), the 
Secretary may develop and impose appropriate 


penalties for non-compliance with such requirements.(e)EXCEPTIONS. In developing the reporting 
requirements under paragraph (1), the 
Secretary may provide for exceptions to such 
requirements for group health plans and health 
insurance issuers that substantially meet the 
goals of this section. 

 (B) WELLNESS AND PREVENTION PROGRAMS. For 
purposes of subsection (a) (1) (D), wellness and health promotion 
activities may include personalized wellness and 
prevention services, which are coordinated, maintained or 
delivered by a health care provider, a wellness and prevention 
plan manager, or a health, wellness or prevention 
services organization that conducts health risk assessments 
or offers ongoing face-to-face, telephonic or web-
based intervention efforts for each of the programs participants, 
and which may include the following wellness 
and prevention efforts:</p>

 (C) REGULATIONS. Not later than 2 years after the 
date of enactment of the Patient Protection and Afford


able Care Act, the Secretary shall promulgate regulations 
that provide criteria for determining whether a reimbursement 
structure is described in subsection (a). (d)  STUDY AND REPORT. Not later than 180 days 
after the date on which regulations are promulgated under 
subsection (c), the Government Accountability Office shall 
review such regulations and conduct a study and submit 
to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions 
of the Senate and the Committee on Energy and 
Commerce of the House of Representatives a report regarding 
the impact the activities under this section have 
had on the quality and cost of health care. 
</p>

<h3>SEC. 2718. BRINGING DOWN THE COST OF HEALTH CARE 

COVERAGE. </h3>
<p>
 (A) CLEAR ACCOUNTING FOR COSTS. A health insurance 
issuer offering group or individual health insurance 
coverage shall, with respect to each plan year, submit 
to the Secretary a report concerning the percentage of 
total premium revenue that such coverage expends</p>


<p>(1) on reimbursement for clinical services pro


vided to enrollees under such coverage;</p>


<p>(2) for activities that improve health care 
quality; and  (3) on all other non-claims costs, including an 
explanation of the nature of such costs, and excluding 
State taxes and licensing or regulatory fees. 

The Secretary shall make reports received under this sec


tion available to the public on the Internet website of the 

Department of Health and Human Services. 

 (B) ENSURING THAT CONSUMERS RECEIVE VALUE 
FOR THEIR PREMIUM PAYMENTS.</p>


<p>(1) REQUIREMENT TO PROVIDE VALUE FOR 
PREMIUM PAYMENTS. A health insurance issuer offering 
group or individual health insurance coverage 
shall, with respect to each plan year, provide an annual 
rebate to each enrollee under such coverage, on 
a pro rata basis, in an amount that is equal to the 
amount by which premium revenue expended by the 
issuer on activities described in subsection (a) (3) exceeds  


 (A) with respect to a health insurance 
issuer offering coverage in the group market, 
20 percent, or such lower percentage as a State 
may by regulation determine; or (B) with respect to a health insurance 
issuer offering coverage in the individual mar




ket, 25 percent, or such lower percentage as a 
State may by regulation determine, except that 
such percentage shall be adjusted to the extent 
the Secretary determines that the application of 
such percentage with a State may destabilize 
the existing individual market in such State.</p>


<p>(2) CONSIDERATION IN SETTING PERCENT-

AGES. In determining the percentages under paragraph (1), a State shall seek to ensure adequate participation 
by health insurance issuers, competition in 
the health insurance market in the State, and value 
for consumers so that premiums are used for clinical 
services and quality improvements.</p>


<p>(3) TERMINATION. The provisions of this 
subsection shall have no force or effect after December 
31, 2013. 
 (C) STANDARD HOSPITAL CHARGES. Each hospital 

operating within the United States shall for each year establish 
(and update) and make public (in accordance with

<p>(2) has not been covered under creditable coverage 
(as defined in section 2701 (c) (1) of the Public 
Health Service Act as in effect on the date of enactment 
of this Act) during the 6-month period prior 
to the date on which such individual is applying for 
coverage through the high risk pool; and  (3) has a pre-existing condition, as determined 
in a manner consistent with guidance issued by the 
Secretary.(e)PROTECTION AGAINST DUMPING RISK BY INSURERS.</p>


<p>(1) IN GENERAL. The Secretary shall establish 
criteria for determining whether health insurance 



issuers and employment-based health plans have discouraged 
an individual from remaining enrolled in 
prior coverage based on that individuals health status.</p>


<p>(2) SANCTIONS. An issuer or employment-
based health plan shall be responsible for reimbursing 
the program under this section for the medical 
expenses incurred by the program for an individual 
who, based on criteria established by the Secretary, 
the Secretary finds was encouraged by the issuer to 
disenroll from health benefits coverage prior to enrolling 
in coverage through the program. The criteria 
shall include at least the following circumstances: 
 (A) In the case of prior coverage obtained 
through an employer, the provision by the employer, 
group health plan, or the issuer of 
money or other financial consideration for 
disenrolling from the coverage. 
 (B) In the case of prior coverage obtained 
directly from an issuer or under an employment-
based health plan (i)  the provision by the issuer or plan 
of money or other financial consideration 
for disenrolling from the coverage; or (ii) in the case of an individual whose 
premium for the prior coverage exceeded 
the premium required by the program</p>


<p>(adjusted 
based on the age factors applied to 
the prior coverage) (i)  the prior coverage is a policy 
that is no longer being actively marketed 
(as defined by the Secretary) by 
the issuer; or (II) the prior coverage is a policy 
for which duration of coverage form 
issue or health status are factors that 
can be considered in determining premiums 
at renewal.</p>


<p>(3) CONSTRUCTION. Nothing in this subsection 
shall be construed as constituting exclusive 
remedies for violations of criteria established under 
paragraph (1) or as preventing States from applying 
or enforcing such paragraph or other provisions 
under law with respect to health insurance issuers.(f) OVERSIGHT. The Secretary shall establish</p>


<p>(1) an appeals process to enable individuals to 
appeal a determination under this section; and  (2) procedures to protect against waste, fraud, 
and abuse. (g) FUNDING; TERMINATION OF AUTHORITY.</p>


<p>(1) IN GENERAL. There is appropriated to the 
Secretary, out of any moneys in the Treasury not 
otherwise appropriated, $5,000,000,000 to pay 
claims against (and the administrative costs of) the 
high risk pool under this section that are in excess 
of the amount of premiums collected from eligible individuals 
enrolled in the high risk pool. Such funds 
shall be available without fiscal year limitation.</p>


<p>(2) INSUFFICIENT FUNDS. If the Secretary estimates 
for any fiscal year that the aggregate 
amounts available for the payment of the expenses 
of the high risk pool will be less than the actual 
amount of such expenses, the Secretary shall make 
such adjustments as are necessary to eliminate such 
deficit.</p>


<p>(3) TERMINATION OF AUTHORITY.  
 (A) IN GENERAL. Except as provided in 
subparagraph (B), coverage of eligible individuals 
under a high risk pool in a State shall terminate 
on January 1, 2014. 
(B) tRANSITION TO EXCHANGE. The 
Secretary shall develop procedures to provide 
for the transition of eligible individuals enrolled 
in health insurance coverage offered through a 


high risk pool established under this section 
into qualified health plans offered through an 
Exchange. Such procedures shall ensure that 
there is no lapse in coverage with respect to the 
individual and may extend coverage after the 
termination of the risk pool involved, if the Secretary 
determines necessary to avoid such a 
lapse.</p>


<p>(4) LIMITATIONS. The Secretary has the authority 
to stop taking applications for participation 
in the program under this section to comply with the 
funding limitation provided for in paragraph (1).</p>


<p>(5) RELATION TO STATE LAWS. The standards 
established under this section shall supersede any 
State law or regulation (other than State licensing 
laws or State laws relating to plan solvency) with respect 
to qualified high risk pools which are established 
in accordance with this section.

of such retirees) during the period beginning on 
the date on which such program is established and 
ending on January 1, 2014.</p>


<p>(2) REFERENCE. In this section: 
 (A) HEALTH BENEFITS. The term 
health benefits means medical, surgical, hospital, 
prescription drug, and such other benefits 
as shall be determined by the Secretary, whether 
self-funded, or delivered through the purchase 
of insurance or otherwise. 
 (B) EMPLOYMENT-BASED PLAN. The 
term employment-based plan means a group 
health benefits plan that (i)  is (i)  maintained by one or more 
current or former employers (including

or a committee or board of individuals 
appointed to administer such 
plan; or (II) a multiemployer plan (as defined 
in section 3</p>
<p>(37) of the Employee

 (C) EARLY RETIREES. The term early 
retirees means individuals who are age 55 and 
older but are not eligible for coverage under 
title XVIII of the Social Security Act, and who 
are not active employees of an employer maintaining, 
or currently contributing to, the employment-
based plan or of any employer that 
has made substantial contributions to fund such 
plan. 
 (B) PARTICIPATION.</p>

under the plan; and  (B) submits to the Secretary an application 
for participation in the program, at such 



time, in such manner, and containing such information 
as the Secretary shall require.</p>


<p>(2) EMPLOYMENT-BASED HEALTH BENEFITS.  
An employment-based plan meets the requirements 
of this paragraph if the plan  
 (A) implements programs and procedures 
to generate cost-savings with respect to participants 
with chronic and high-cost conditions; 
 (B) provides documentation of the actual 
cost of medical claims involved; and  (C) is certified by the Secretary. 
 (C) PAYMENTS.</p>


<p>(1) SUBMISSION OF CLAIMS.

to the Secretary which shall contain 
documentation of the actual costs of the items 
and services for which each claim is being submitted.

under subparagraph (A) shall be based on the 
actual amount expended by the participating 
employment-based plan involved within the plan 
year for the health benefits provided to an early 
retiree or the spouse, surviving spouse, or de


pendent of such retiree. In determining the 
amount of a claim for purposes of this subsection, 
the participating employment-based 
plan shall take into account any negotiated 
price concessions (such as discounts, direct or 
indirect subsidies, rebates, and direct or indirect 
remunerations) obtained by such plan with 
respect to such health benefit. For purposes of 
determining the amount of any such claim, the 
costs paid by the early retiree or the retirees 
spouse, surviving spouse, or dependent in the 
form of deductibles, co-payments, or co-insurance 
shall be included in the amounts paid by 
the participating employment-based plan.</p>


<p>(2) PROGRAM PAYMENTS. If the Secretary determines

increase in the Medical Care Component of 
the Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers</p>


<p>(rounded to the nearest multiple of $1,000) for the 
year involved.</p>


<p>(4) USE OF PAYMENTS. Amounts paid to a 
participating employment-based plan under this subsection 
shall be used to lower costs for the plan. 
Such payments may be used to reduce premium 
costs for an entity described in subsection (a) (2) (B) (i) or to reduce premium contributions, co-
payments, deductibles, co-insurance, or other out-of-
pocket costs for plan participants. Such payments 
shall not be used as general revenues for an entity 
described in subsection (a) (2) (B) (i). The Secretary 
shall develop a mechanism to monitor the appropriate 
use of such payments by such entities.</p>


<p>(5) PAYMENTS NOT TREATED AS INCOME.  
Payments received under this subsection shall not be 
included in determining the gross income of an entity 
described in subsection (a) (2) (B) (i) that is maintaining 
or currently contributing to a participating 
employment-based plan.</p>


<p>(6) APPEALS. The Secretary shall establish  



 (A) an appeals process to permit participating

subsection as a wellness program) shall be a 
program offered by an employer that is designed 
to promote health or prevent disease

subsection.85 


 (B) NO CONDITIONS BASED ON HEALTH 
STATUS FACTOR. If none of the conditions for 
obtaining a premium discount or rebate or 
other reward for participation in a wellness program 
is based on an individual satisfying a 
standard that is related to a health status factor, 
such wellness program shall not violate this 
section if participation in the program is made 
available to all similarly situated individuals 
and the requirements of paragraph (2) are complied 
with. 

 (C) CONDITIONS BASED ON HEALTH STATUS 
FACTOR. If any of the conditions for obtaining 
a premium discount or rebate or other 
reward for participation in a wellness program 
is based on an individual satisfying a standard 
that is related to a health status factor, such 
wellness program shall not violate this section if 
the requirements of paragraph (3) are complied 
with.</p>


<p>(2) WELLNESS PROGRAMS NOT SUBJECT TO 

REQUIREMENTS. If none of the conditions for ob


taining a premium discount or rebate or other re


ward under a wellness program as described in para


(1) (B) are based on an individual satisfying86 


a standard that is related to a health status factor 
(or if such a wellness program does not provide such 
a reward), the wellness program shall not violate 
this section if participation in the program is made 
available to all similarly situated individuals. The 
following programs shall not have to comply with the 
requirements of paragraph (3) if participation in the 
program is made available to all similarly situated 
individuals: 

 (A) A program that reimburses all or 
part of the cost for memberships in a fitness 
center. 

 (B) A diagnostic testing program that 
provides a reward for participation and does 
not base any part of the reward on outcomes. 

 (C) A program that encourages preventive 
care related to a health condition through 
the waiver of the copayment or deductible requirement 
under group health plan for the costs 
of certain items or services related to a health 
condition (such as prenatal care or well-baby 
visits). (d)  A program that reimburses individuals 
for the costs of smoking cessation pro87 


grams without regard to whether the individual 
quits smoking.(e)A program that provides a reward to 
individuals for attending a periodic health education 
seminar.</p>


<p>(3) WELLNESS PROGRAMS SUBJECT TO RE-

QUIREMENTS. If any of the conditions for obtaining 
a premium discount, rebate, or reward under a 
wellness program as described in paragraph (1) (C) 
is based on an individual satisfying a standard that 
is related to a health status factor, the wellness program 
shall not violate this section if the following requirements 
are complied with: 

 (A) The reward for the wellness program, 
together with the reward for other wellness programs 
with respect to the plan that requires 
satisfaction of a standard related to a health 
status factor, shall not exceed 30 percent of the 
cost of employee-only coverage under the plan. 
If, in addition to employees or individuals, any 
class of dependents (such as spouses or spouses 
and dependent children) may participate fully 
in the wellness program, such reward shall not 
exceed 30 percent of the cost of the coverage in 
which an employee or individual and any de88 


pendents are enrolled. For purposes of this 
paragraph, the cost of coverage shall be determined 
based on the total amount of employer 
and employee contributions for the benefit 
package under which the employee is (or the 
employee and any dependents are) receiving 
coverage. A reward may be in the form of a discount 
or rebate of a premium or contribution, 
a waiver of all or part of a cost-sharing mechanism 
(such as deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance), 
the absence of a surcharge, or the 
value of a benefit that would otherwise not be 
provided under the plan. The Secretaries of 
Labor, Health and Human Services, and the 
Treasury may increase the reward available 
under this subparagraph to up to 50 percent of 
the cost of coverage if the Secretaries determine 
that such an increase is appropriate. 

(B) the wellness program shall be reasonably 
designed to promote health or prevent 
disease. A program complies with the preceding 
sentence if the program has a reasonable 
chance of improving the health of, or preventing 
disease in, participating individuals and it is 
not overly burdensome, is not a subterfuge for89 


discriminating based on a health status factor, 
and is not highly suspect in the method chosen 
to promote health or prevent disease. 

 (C) The plan shall give individuals eligible 
for the program the opportunity to qualify for 
the reward under the program at least once 
each year. (d)  The full reward under the wellness 
program shall be made available to all similarly 
situated individuals. For such purpose, among 
other things: (i)  The reward is not available to all 
similarly situated individuals for a period 
unless the wellness program allows (i)  for a reasonable alternative 
standard (or waiver of the otherwise 
applicable standard) for obtaining the 
reward for any individual for whom, 
for that period, it is unreasonably difficult 
due to a medical condition to 
satisfy the otherwise applicable standard; 
and  (II) for a reasonable alternative 
standard (or waiver of the otherwise 
applicable standard) for obtaining the90 


reward for any individual for whom, 
for that period, it is medically inadvisable

shall not be treated as providing coverage for106 


the essential health benefits described in paragraph (1) unless the plan provides that (i)  coverage for emergency department 
services will be provided without imposing 
any requirement under the plan for prior 
authorization of services or any limitation 
on coverage where the provider of services 
does not have a contractual relationship 
with the plan for the providing of services 
that is more restrictive than the requirements 
or limitations that apply to emergency 
department services received from 
providers who do have such a contractual 
relationship with the plan; and  (ii) if such services are provided out-

1311 (B) (2) (B) (ii)  (relating to stand-alone 
dental benefits plans) is offered through an Exchange, 
another health plan offered through 
such Exchange shall not fail to be treated as a107 


qualified health plan solely because the plan 
does not offer coverage of benefits offered 
through the stand-alone plan that are otherwise 
required under paragraph (1) (J); and  (G) periodically review the essential health 
benefits under paragraph (1), and provide a report 
to Congress and the public that contains (i)  an assessment of whether enrollees 
are facing any difficulty accessing needed 
services for reasons of coverage or cost; (ii) an assessment of whether the essential 
health benefits needs to be modified 
or updated to account for changes in medical 
evidence or scientific advancement; (iii) information on how the essential 
health benefits will be modified to address 
any such gaps in access or changes in the 
evidence base; (iv) an assessment of the potential of 
additional or expanded benefits to increase 
costs and the interactions between the addition 
or expansion of benefits and reductions 
in existing benefits to meet actuarial 
limitations described in paragraph (2); and108 (h) periodically update the essential health

amount equal to the product of that 
amount and the premium adjustment percentage 
under paragraph (4) for the calendar 
year; and  (ii) in the case of other coverage, 
twice the amount in effect under clause (i). 
If the amount of any increase under clause (i)

under this paragraph shall be applied in such a111 


manner so as to not affect the actuarial value 
of any health plan, including a plan in the

may actually provide benefits to). 
 (B) EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS. The 
Secretary may issue regulations under which 
employer contributions to a health savings account 
(within the meaning of section 223 of the 
Internal Revenue Code of 1986) may be taken 
into account in determining the level of coverage 
for a plan of the employer.

paragraph (2); and  (B) the plan provides115 (i)  except as provided in clause (ii), 
the essential health benefits determined

limitation in effect under subsection (c) (1) 
for the plan year (except as provided for in 
section 2713); and  (ii) coverage for at least three primary 
care visits.</p>


<p>(2) INDIVIDUALS ELIGIBLE FOR ENROLL-
MENT. An individual is described in this paragraph 
for any plan year if the individual

a health insurance issuer offers a health plan described 
in this subsection, the issuer may only offer 
the plan in the individual market.(f) CHILD-ONLY PLANS. If a qualified health plan 
is offered through the Exchange in any level of coverage 
specified under subsection (d), the issuer shall also offer 
that plan through the Exchange in that level as a plan 
in which the only enrollees are individuals who, as of the 
beginning of a plan year, have not attained the age of 21, 
and such plan shall be treated as a qualified health plan.

HEALTH PROGRAMS FOR LOW-INCOME INDI


VIDUALS NOT ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID. </h3>

 (A) ESTABLISHMENT OF PROGRAM.</p>


<p>(1) IN GENERAL. The Secretary shall establish 
a basic health program meeting the requirements of 
this section under which a State may enter into contracts 
to offer 1 or more standard health plans providing

in section 1302 (b) to eligible individuals in lieu of 
offering such individuals coverage through an Exchange. 
(2) CERTIFICATIONS AS TO BENEFIT COVERAGE 
AND COSTS. Such program shall provide that a 
State may not establish a basic health program 
under this section unless the State establishes to the202 

satisfaction of the Secretary, and the Secretary certifies, 
that  

 (A) in the case of an eligible individual enrolled 
in a standard health plan offered through 
the program, the State provides (i)  that the amount of the monthly 
premium an eligible individual is required 
to pay for coverage under the standard 
health plan for the individual and the individuals 
dependents does not exceed the 
amount of the monthly premium that the 
eligible individual would have been required 
to pay (in the rating area in which the individual 
resides) if the individual had enrolled 
in the applicable second lowest cost 
silver plan (as defined in section 
36B (b)(3) (B) of the Internal Revenue 
Code of 1986) offered to the individual 
through an Exchange; and  (ii) that the cost-sharing an eligible 
individual is required to pay under the 
standard health plan does not exceed (i)  the cost-sharing required 
under a platinum plan in the case of 
an eligible individual with household203 


income not in excess of 150 percent of 
the poverty line for the size of the 
family involved; and  (II) the cost-sharing required 
under a gold plan in the case of an eligible 
individual not described in sub-
clause (I); and (B) the benefits provided under the standard 
health plans offered through the program 
cover at least the essential health benefits described 
in section 1302(b). 
For purposes of subparagraph (a) (i), the amount of 
the monthly premium an individual is required to 
pay under either the standard health plan or the applicable 
second lowest cost silver plan shall be determined 
after reduction for any premium tax credits 
and cost-sharing reductions allowable with respect to 
either plan. 

 (B) STANDARD HEALTH PLAN. In this section, the 
term standard heath plan means a health benefits plan 
that the State contracts with under this section</p>

Consideration of, and the making 
of suitable allowances for, differences in health 
care needs of enrollees and differences in local 
availability of, and access to, health care providers. 
Nothing in this subparagraph shall be 
construed as allowing discrimination on the 
basis of pre-existing conditions or other health 
status-related factors. 
 (C) MANAGED CARE. Contracting with 
managed care systems, or with systems that 
offer as many of the attributes of managed care 
as are feasible in the local health care market. (d)  PERFORMANCE MEASURES. Establishing 
specific performance measures and 
standards for issuers of standard health plans 
that focus on quality of care and improved 
health outcomes, requiring such plans to report 
to the State with respect to the measures and206 


standards, and making the performance and 
quality information available to enrollees in a 
useful form.</p>


<p>(3) ENHANCED AVAILABILITY.

the maximum extent feasible, seek to make 
multiple standard health plans available to eligible 
individuals within a State to ensure individuals 
have a choice of such plans.

negotiate a regional compact with other States 
to include coverage of eligible individuals in all 
such States in agreements with issuers of 
standard health plans.</p>


<p>(4) COORDINATION WITH OTHER STATE PROGRAMS. 
A State shall seek to coordinate the administration 
of, and provision of benefits under, its program 
under this section with the State medicaid program

the State for each fiscal year for which 1 or more 
standard health plans are operating within the State 
the amount determined under paragraph (3).</p>


<p>(2) USE OF FUNDS. A State shall establish a 
trust for the deposit of the amounts received under 
paragraph (1) and amounts in the trust fund shall 
only be used to reduce the premiums and cost-sharing 
of, or to provide additional benefits for, eligible 
individuals enrolled in standard health plans within 
the State. Amounts in the trust fund, and expenditures 
of such amounts, shall not be included in determining 
the amount of any non-Federal funds for 
purposes of meeting any matching or expenditure requirement 
of any federally-funded program.</p>


<p>(3) AMOUNT OF PAYMENT.  
 (A) SECRETARIAL DETERMINATION. (i)  IN GENERAL. The amount determined 
under this paragraph for any fiscal 
year is the amount the Secretary determines 
is equal to 85 percent of the premium

the fiscal year to eligible individuals enrolled 
in standard health plans in the State 
if such eligible individuals were allowed to 
enroll in qualified health plans through an 
Exchange established under this subtitle. (ii) SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS. The 
Secretary shall make the determination 
under clause (i) on a per enrollee basis and 
shall take into account all relevant factors 
necessary to determine the value of the 
premium tax credits and cost-sharing reductions

eligible individuals described in clause (i), 
including the age and income of the enrollee, 
whether the enrollment is for self-
only or family coverage, geographic differences 
in average spending for health 
care across rating areas, the health status 
of the enrollee for purposes of determining 
risk adjustment payments and reinsurance 
payments that would have been made if 
the enrollee had enrolled in a qualified 209 

health plan through an Exchange, and 
whether any reconciliation of the credit or 
cost-sharing reductions would have occurred 
if the enrollee had been so enrolled. 
This determination shall take into consideration 
the experience of other States with 
respect to participation in an Exchange 
and such credits and reductions provided 
to residents of the other States, with a special 
focus on enrollees with income below 
200 percent of poverty. (iii) CERTIFICATION. The Chief Actuary 
of the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid 
Services, in consultation with the Office 
of Tax Analysis of the Department of

sufficient data from the State and from 
comparable States about their experience 
with programs created by this Act.

<h2>PART V REINSURANCE AND RISK ADJUSTMENT 
</h2><h3>SEC. 1341. TRANSITIONAL REINSURANCE PROGRAM FOR 

INDIVIDUAL AND SMALL GROUP MARKETS IN 

EACH STATE. </h3>

 <p>(a) IN GENERAL. Each State shall, not later than 
January 1, 2014</p>


<p>(1) include in the Federal standards or State 
law or regulation the State adopts and has in effect 
under section 1321(B) the provisions described in 
subsection (b); and 227</p>


<p>(2) establish (or enter into a contract with) 1 
or more applicable reinsurance entities to carry out 
the reinsurance program under this section. 
 (B) MODEL REGULATION.</p>


<p>(1) IN GENERAL. In establishing the Federal 
standards under section 1321(a), the Secretary, in 
consultation with the National Association of Insurance 
Commissioners (the NAIC), shall include 
provisions that enable States to establish and maintain 
a program under which  
(A) health insurance issuers, and third 
party administrators on behalf of group health 
plans, are required to make payments to an applicable 
reinsurance entity for any plan year beginning 
in the 3-year period beginning January 
1, 2014 (as specified in paragraph (3); and 
(B) the applicable reinsurance entity collects 
payments under subparagraph (A) and 
uses amounts so collected to make reinsurance 
payments to health insurance issuers described 
in subparagraph (A) that cover high risk individuals 
in the individual market (excluding 
grandfathered health plans) for any plan year 
beginning in such 3-year period.228</p>


<p>(2) HIGH-RISK INDIVIDUAL; PAYMENT 
AMOUNTS. The Secretary shall include the following 
in the provisions under paragraph (1): 
 (A) DETERMINATION OF HIGH-RISK INDI-
VIDUALS. The method by which individuals 
will be identified as high risk individuals for 
purposes of the reinsurance program established 
under this section. Such method shall 
provide for identification of individuals as high-
risk individuals on the basis of  
(i) a list of at least 50 but not more 
than 100 medical conditions that are identified 
as high-risk conditions and that may 
be based on the identification of diagnostic 
and procedure codes that are indicative of 
individuals with pre-existing, high-risk conditions; 
or (ii) any other comparable objective 
method of identification recommended by 
the American Academy of Actuaries. 
 (B) PAYMENT AMOUNT. The formula for 
determining the amount of payments that will 
be paid to health insurance issuers described in 
paragraph (1) (A) that insure high-risk individuals. 
Such formula shall provide for the equi229 


table allocation of available funds through reconciliation 
and may be designed  

(i) to provide a schedule of payments 
that specifies the amount that will be paid 
for each of the conditions identified under 
subparagraph (A); or (ii) to use any other comparable method 
for determining payment amounts that 
is recommended by the American Academy 
of Actuaries and that encourages the use 
of care coordination and care management 
programs for high risk conditions.</p>


<p>(3) DETERMINATION OF REQUIRED CONTRIBUTIONS.  
 (A) IN GENERAL. The Secretary shall include 
in the provisions under paragraph (1) the 
method for determining the amount each health

reinsurance program under this section is required 
to contribute under such paragraph for 
each plan year beginning in the 36-month period 
beginning January 1, 2014. The contribution 
amount for any plan year may be based on 
the percentage of revenue of each issuer and230 


the total costs of providing benefits to enrollees 
in self-insured plans or on a specified amount 
per enrollee and may be required to be paid in 
advance or periodically throughout the plan 
year. 

 (B) SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS. The method 
under this paragraph shall be designed so 
that (i)  the contribution amount for each 
issuer proportionally reflects each issuers 
fully insured commercial book of business 
for all major medical products and the 
total value of all fees charged by the issuer 
and the costs of coverage administered by 
the issuer as a third party administrator; (ii) the contribution amount can include 
an additional amount to fund the administrative 
expenses of the applicable reinsurance 
entity; (iii) the aggregate contribution 
amounts for all States shall, based on the 
best estimates of the NAIC and without 
regard to amounts described in clause (ii), 
equal $10,000,000,000 for plan years beginning 
in 2014, $6,000,000,000 for plan231 


years beginning 2015, and $4,000,000,000 
for plan years beginning in 2016; and  (iv) in addition to the aggregate contribution 
amounts under clause (iii), each 
issuers contribution amount for any calendar 
year under clause (iii) reflects its 
proportionate share of an additional 
$2,000,000,000 for 2014, an additional 
$2,000,000,000 for 2015, and an additional 
$1,000,000,000 for 2016. 
Nothing in this subparagraph shall be construed 
to preclude a State from collecting additional 
amounts from issuers on a voluntary 
basis.</p>


<p>(4) EXPENDITURE OF FUNDS. The provisions 
under paragraph (1) shall provide that  
 (A) the contribution amounts collected for 
any calendar year may be allocated and used in 
any of the three calendar years for which 
amounts are collected based on the reinsurance 
needs of a particular period or to reflect experience 
in a prior period; and  (B) amounts remaining unexpended as of 
December, 2016, may be used to make payments 
under any reinsurance program of a232 


State in the individual market in effect in the 

2-year period beginning on January 1, 2017. 

Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, any con


tribution amounts described in paragraph (3) (b)(iv)

adverse selection related to new rating rules 
and market changes is greatest; and 
(B) the duties of which shall be to carry 
out the reinsurance program under this section 
by coordinating the funding and operation of 
the risk-spreading mechanisms designed to implement 
the reinsurance program.233</p>


<p>(2) STATE DISCRETION. A State may have 
more than 1 applicable reinsurance entity to carry 
out the reinsurance program under this section within 
the State and 2 or more States may enter into 
agreements to provide for an applicable reinsurance 
entity to carry out such program in all such States.</p>


<p>(3) ENTITIES ARE TAX-EXEMPT. An applicable 
reinsurance entity established under this section 
shall be exempt from taxation under chapter 1 of 
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The preceding 
sentence shall not apply to the tax imposed by section 
511 such Code (relating to tax on unrelated 
business taxable income of an exempt organization). (d)  COORDINATION WITH STATE HIGH-RISK 
POOLS. The State shall eliminate or modify any State 
high-risk pool to the extent necessary to carry out the reinsurance

health plan making reductions under this subsection 
shall notify the Secretary of such reductions 
and the Secretary shall make periodic and 
timely payments to the issuer equal to the value 
of the reductions. 
 (B) CAPITATED PAYMENTS. The Secretary 
may establish a capitated payment system 
to carry out the payment of cost-sharing 
reductions under this section. Any such system

such payments.</p>


<p>(4) ADDITIONAL BENEFITS. If a qualified 
health plan under section 1302 (B) (5) offers benefits 
in addition to the essential health benefits required 
to be provided by the plan, or a State requires a264 


qualified health plan under section 1311 (d)  (3)(B) to

required to be provided by the plan, the reductions 
in cost-sharing under this section shall not

<p>(5) SPECIAL RULE FOR PEDIATRIC DENTAL 
PLANS. If an individual enrolls in both a qualified 
health plan and a plan described in section

provided by a qualified health plan under section 
1302(b)(1) (J). (d)  SPECIAL RULES FOR INDIANS.</p>

Act</p>


<p>(25 U.S.C. 450b (d) )) whose household income 
is not more than 300 percent of the poverty265 


line for a family of the size involved, then, for purposes

 (A) no cost-sharing under the plan shall be 
imposed under the plan for such item or service; 
and  (B) the issuer of the plan shall not reduce

insured is not lawfully present  
 (A) no cost-sharing reduction under this 
section shall apply with respect to the individual; 
and  (B) for purposes of applying this section, 
the determination as to what percentage a taxpayers 
household income bears to the poverty 
level for a family of the size involved shall be 
made under one of the following methods: (i)  A method under which (i)  the taxpayers family size is 
determined by not taking such individuals 
into account, and  (II) the taxpayers household income 
is equal to the product of the 
taxpayers household income (determined 
without regard to this subsection) 
and a fraction (aa) the numerator of which 
is the poverty line for the taxpayers 
family size determined267 


after application of subclause (I), 
and  (bb) the denominator of 
which is the poverty line for the 
taxpayers family size determined 
without regard to subclause (I). (ii) A comparable method reaching the 
same result as the method under clause (i).</p>

<p>(3) SECRETARIAL AUTHORITY. The Secretary, 
in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, 
shall prescribe rules setting forth the methods by 
which calculations of family size and household income 
are made for purposes of this subsection. Such 
rules shall be designed to ensure that the least burden 
is placed on individuals enrolling in qualified 
health plans through an Exchange and taxpayers eligible 
for the credit allowable under this section.268(f) DEFINITIONS AND SPECIAL RULES. In this section:</p>


<p>(1) IN GENERAL. Any term used in this section

sharing reduction shall be allowed under this section 
with respect to coverage for any month unless the 
month is a coverage month with respect to which a 
credit is allowed to the insured (or an applicable taxpayer 
on behalf of the insured) under section 36B 
of such Code.</p>


<p>(3) DATA USED FOR ELIGIBILITY. Any determination 
under this section shall be made on the 
basis of the taxable year for which the advance determination 
is made under section 1412 and not the 
taxable year for which the credit under section 36B 
of such Code is allowed.</p>

<h2>PART I INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY 
</h2>
<h3>SEC. 1501. REQUIREMENT TO MAINTAIN MINIMUM ESSENTIAL 
COVERAGE. </h3>

<p>(A) FINDINGS. Congress makes the following find 
ings: 
</p>


<p>(1) IN GENERAL. The individual responsibility 
requirement provided for in this section (in this subsection 
referred to as the requirement) is commercial and economic in nature, and substantially affects 
interstate commerce, as a result of the effects 
described in paragraph (2).</p>


<p>(2) EFFECTS ON THE NATIONAL ECONOMY AND 
INTERSTATE COMMERCE. The effects described in 
this paragraph are the following: 
 (A) The requirement regulates activity that 
is commercial and economic in nature: economic 
and financial decisions about how and when 
health care is paid for, and when health insurance 
is purchased. 
 (B) Health insurance and health care services 
are a significant part of the national economy. 
National health spending is projected to 
increase from $2,500,000,000,000, or 17.6 percent 
of the economy, in 2009 to 
$4,700,000,000,000 in 2019. Private health insurance 
spending is projected to be 
$854,000,000,000 in 2009, and pays for medical 
supplies, drugs, and equipment that are 
shipped in interstate commerce. Since most 
health insurance is sold by national or regional 
health insurance companies, health insurance is 
sold in interstate commerce and claims payments 
flow through interstate commerce.322 


 (C) The requirement, together with the 
other provisions of this Act, will add millions of 
new consumers to the health insurance market, 
increasing the supply of, and demand for, 
health care services. According to the Congressional 
Budget Office, the requirement will increase 
the number and share of Americans who 
are insured. (d)  The requirement achieves near-universal 
coverage by building upon and strengthening 
the private employer-based health insurance 
system, which covers 176,000,000 Americans 
nationwide. In Massachusetts, a similar requirement 
has strengthened private employer-
based coverage: despite the economic downturn, 
the number of workers offered employer-based 
coverage has actually increased.(e)Half of all personal bankruptcies are 
caused in part by medical expenses. By significantly 
increasing health insurance coverage, the 
requirement, together with the other provisions 
of this Act, will improve financial security for 
families.(f) Under the Employee Retirement Income 
Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.), the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 
201 et seq.), and this Act, the Federal Government 
has a significant role in regulating health 
insurance which is in interstate commerce. (g) Under sections 2704 and 2705 of the 
Public Health Service Act (as added by section 
1201 of this Act), if there were no requirement, 
many individuals would wait to purchase health 
insurance until they needed care. By significantly 
increasing health insurance coverage, the 
requirement, together with the other provisions 
of this Act, will minimize this adverse selection 
and broaden the health insurance risk pool to 
include healthy individuals, which will lower 
health insurance premiums. The requirement is 
essential to creating effective health insurance 
markets in which improved health insurance 
products that are guaranteed issue and do not 
exclude coverage of pre-existing conditions can 
be sold. (h) Administrative costs for private health 
insurance, which were $90,000,000,000 in 
2006, are 26 to 30 percent of premiums in the 
current individual and small group markets. By 
significantly increasing health insurance coverage and the size of purchasing pools, which 
will increase economies of scale, the requirement, together with the other provisions of this 
Act, will significantly reduce administrative 
costs and lower health insurance premiums. 
The requirement is essential to creating effective health insurance markets that do not require underwriting and eliminate its associated 
administrative costs. 
</p>


<p>(3) SUPREME COURT RULING. In United States v. South-Eastern Underwriters Association (322 U.S. 533 (1944)), the Supreme Court of the 
United States ruled that insurance is interstate com14 
merce subject to Federal regulation. 
 (B) IN GENERAL. Subtitle D of the Internal Rev16 
enue Code of 1986 is amended by adding at the end the 
following new chapter: 
</p>

eligibility level that is not less than the income 
eligibility level that applied under the

<p>
 (A) IN GENERAL. Section 1902(e) of the Social Security 
Act (42 U.S.C. 1396a(e)) is amended by adding at 
the end the following:</p>


<p>(14) INCOME DETERMINED USING MODIFIED 
GROSS INCOME.  

 (A) IN GENERAL. Notwithstanding subsection (r) or any other provision of this title, 
except as provided in subparagraph (D), for 
purposes of determining income eligibility for 
medical assistance under the State plan or 
under any waiver of such plan and for any 
other purpose applicable under the plan or 
waiver for which a determination of income is 
required, including with respect to the imposition 
of premiums and cost-sharing, a State 



shall use the modified gross income of an individual 
and, in the case of an individual in a 
family greater than 1, the household income of 
such family. A State shall establish income eligibility 
thresholds for populations to be eligible 
for medical assistance under the State plan or 
a waiver of the plan using modified gross income 
and household income that are not less 
than the effective income eligibility levels that 
applied under the State plan or waiver on the 
date of enactment of the Patient Protection and 
Affordable Care Act. For purposes of complying 
with the maintenance of effort requirements 
under subsection (gg) during the transition to 
modified gross income and household income, a 
State shall, working with the Secretary, establish 
an equivalent income test that ensures individuals 
eligible for medical assistance under the 
State plan or under a waiver of the plan on the 
date of enactment of the Patient Protection and 
Affordable Care Act, do not lose coverage under 
the State plan or under a waiver of the plan. 
The Secretary may waive such provisions of this 
title and title XXI as are necessary to ensure 


that States establish income and eligibility determination 
systems that protect beneficiaries. 

 (B) NO INCOME OR EXPENSE DIS-
REGARDS. No type of expense, block, or other 
income disregard shall be applied by a State to 
determine income eligibility for medical assistance 
under the State plan or under any waiver 
of such plan or for any other purpose applicable 
under the plan or waiver for which a determination 
of income is required. 

 (C) NO ASSETS TEST. A State shall not 
apply any assets or resources test for purposes 
of determining eligibility for medical assistance 
under the State plan or under a waiver of the 
plan. (d)  EXCEPTIONS. (i)  INDIVIDUALS ELIGIBLE BECAUSE 
OF OTHER AID OR ASSISTANCE, ELDERLY 
INDIVIDUALS, MEDICALLY NEEDY INDIVIDUALS, 
AND INDIVIDUALS ELIGIBLE FOR 
MEDICARE COST-SHARING. Subparagraphs 
(A), (B), and  (C) shall not apply to 
the determination of eligibility under the 
State plan or under a waiver for medical 
assistance for the following: 

 (i)  Individuals who are eligible 
for medical assistance under the State 
plan or under a waiver of the plan on 
a basis that does not require a determination 
of income by the State agency 
administering the State plan or 
waiver, including as a result of eligibility 
for, or receipt of, other Federal 
or State aid or assistance, individuals 
who are eligible on the basis of receiving 
(or being treated as if receiving) 
supplemental security income benefits 
under title XVI, and individuals who 
are eligible as a result of being or 
being deemed to be a child in foster 
care under the responsibility of the 
State. (ii) Individuals who have attained 
age 65. (iii) Individuals who qualify for 
medical assistance under the State 
plan or under any waiver of such plan 
on the basis of being blind or disabled 
(or being treated as being blind or 
disabled) without regard to whether the individual is eligible for supplemental 
security income benefits under 
title XVI on the basis of being blind 
or disabled and including an individual 
who is eligible for medical assistance 
on the basis of section 
1902(e)(3). (iv) Individuals described in 
subsection (a) (10) (C) . 
(V) Individuals described in any 
clause of subsection (a) (10)(e). 
(ii) EXPRESS LANE AGENCY FIND-

INGS. In the case of a State that elects 
the Express Lane option under paragraph (13), notwithstanding subparagraphs 
(A), (B), and  (C), the State may rely on a finding 
made by an Express Lane agency in 
accordance with that paragraph relating to 
the income of an individual for purposes of 
determining the individuals eligibility for 
medical assistance under the State plan or 
under a waiver of the plan. (iii) MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG 
SUBSIDIES DETERMINATIONS. Subparagraphs 
(A), (B), and  (C) shall not apply to any determinations of eligibility for premium 
and cost-sharing subsidies under 
and in accordance with section 1860D14 
made by the State pursuant to section 
1935 (A) (2). (iv) LONG-TERM CARE. Subparagraphs 
(A), (B), and  (C) shall not apply to 
any determinations of eligibility of individuals 
for purposes of medical assistance for 
nursing facility services, a level of care in 
any institution equivalent to that of nursing 
facility services, home or community-
based services furnished under a waiver or 
State plan amendment under section 1915 
or a waiver under section 1115, and services 
described in section 1917 (C) (1) (C) (ii). (v) GRANDFATHER OF CURRENT ENROLLEES 
UNTIL DATE OF NEXT REGULAR 
REDETERMINATION. An individual who, 
on January 1, 2014, is enrolled in the 
State plan or under a waiver of the plan 
and who would be determined ineligible for 
medical assistance solely because of the application 
of the modified gross income or 
household income standard described in subparagraph (A), shall remain eligible for 
medical assistance under the State plan or 
waiver (and subject to the same premiums 
and cost-sharing as applied to the individual 
on that date) through March 31, 
2014, or the date on which the individuals 
next regularly scheduled redetermination of 
eligibility is to occur, whichever is later.(e)TRANSITION PLANNING AND OVER-

SIGHT. Each State shall submit to the Secretary 
for the Secretarys approval the income 
eligibility thresholds proposed to be established 
using modified gross income and household income, 
the methodologies and procedures to be 
used to determine income eligibility using modified 
gross income and household income and, if 
applicable, a State plan amendment establishing 
an optional eligibility category under subsection (a) (10) (A) (ii)</p>
<p>(XX). To the extent practicable, 
the State shall use the same methodologies and 
procedures for purposes of making such determinations 
as the State used on the date of enactment 
of the Patient Protection and Affordable 
Care Act. The Secretary shall ensure that 
the income eligibility thresholds proposed to be established using modified gross income and 
household income, including under the eligibility 
category established under subsection (a) (10) (A) (ii)</p>
<p>(XX), and the methodologies and 
procedures proposed to be used to determine income 
eligibility, will not result in children who 
would have been eligible for medical assistance 
under the State plan or under a waiver of the 
plan on the date of enactment of the Patient 
Protection and Affordable Care Act no longer 
being eligible for such assistance.(f) LIMITATION ON SECRETARIAL AU-
THORITY. The Secretary shall not waive compliance 
with the requirements of this paragraph 
except to the extent necessary to permit a State 
to coordinate eligibility requirements for dual 
eligible individuals (as defined in section 
1915 (h)</p>
<p>(2)(b)) under the State plan or under 
a waiver of the plan and under title XVIII and 
individuals who require the level of care provided 
in a hospital, a nursing facility, or an intermediate 
care facility for the mentally retarded. (g) DEFINITIONS OF MODIFIED GROSS

Americans Act of 1965 (42 U.S.C. 3012). 
<h3>SEC. 2406. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING LONG-TERM 

CARE. </h3>

 (A) FINDINGS. The Senate makes the following 
findings:</p>


<p>(1) Nearly 2 decades have passed since Congress 
seriously considered long-term care reform. 
The United States Bipartisan Commission on Comprehensive 
Health Care, also know as the Pepper 

Commission, released its Call for Action blueprint 
for health reform in September 1990. In the 
20 years since those recommendations were made, 
Congress has never acted on the report.</p>


<p>(2) In 1999, under the United States Supreme 
Courts decision in Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581</p>


<p>(1999), individuals with disabilities have the right to 
choose to receive their long-term services and supports 
in the community, rather than in an institutional 
setting.</p>


<p>(3) Despite the Pepper Commission and 
Olmstead decision, the long-term care provided to 
our Nations elderly and disabled has not improved. 
In fact, for many, it has gotten far worse.</p>


<p>(4) In 2007, 69 percent of Medicaid long-term 
care spending for elderly individuals and adults with 
physical disabilities paid for institutional services. 
Only 6 states spent 50 percent or more of their 
Medicaid long-term care dollars on home and community-
based services for elderly individuals and 
adults with physical disabilities while 1Ú2 of the 
States spent less than 25 percent. This disparity 
continues even though, on average, it is estimated 
that Medicaid dollars can support nearly 3 elderly 
individuals and adults with physical disabilities in 

home and community-based services for every individual 
in a nursing home. Although every State has 
chosen to provide certain services under home and 
community-based waivers, these services are unevenly 
available within and across States, and reach 
a small percentage of eligible individuals. 

 (B) SENSE OF THE SENATE. It is the sense of the 
Senate that (1) during the 111th session of Congress, Congress 
should address long-term services and supports 
in a comprehensive way that guarantees elderly and 
disabled individuals the care they need; and  (2) long term services and supports should be 
made available in the community in addition to in 
institutions.

the reduction for such quarter was greater or less than the amount of payment reduction 
that should have been made. (ii) MANNER OF PAYMENT REDUC-
TION. The amount of the payment reduction 
under clause (i) for a State for a 
quarter shall be deemed an overpayment to 
the State under this title to be disallowed

<p>(1) The demonstration project shall be conducted 
in up to 8 States, determined by the Secretary 
based on consideration of the potential to 
lower costs under the Medicaid program while improving 
care for Medicaid beneficiaries. A State selected 
to participate in the demonstration project 
may target the demonstration project to particular 
categories of beneficiaries, beneficiaries with particular 
diagnoses, or particular geographic regions of 
the State, but the Secretary shall insure that, as a 
whole, the demonstration project is, to the greatest 
extent possible, representative of the demographic 

and geographic composition of Medicaid beneficiaries 
nationally.</p>

<p>(2) The demonstration project shall focus on 
conditions where there is evidence of an opportunity 
for providers of services and suppliers to improve the 
quality of care furnished to Medicaid beneficiaries 
while reducing total expenditures under the State 
Medicaid programs selected to participate, as determined 
by the Secretary.</p>

<p>(3) A State selected to participate in the demonstration 
project shall specify the 1 or more episodes 
of care the State proposes to address in the 
project, the services to be included in the bundled 
payments, and the rationale for the selection of such 
episodes of care and services. The Secretary may

made under the demonstration project are adjusted 
for severity of illness and other characteristics of 
Medicaid beneficiaries within a category or having a 
diagnosis targeted as part of the demonstration 

project. States shall ensure that Medicaid beneficiaries 
are not liable for any additional cost sharing 
than if their care had not been subject to payment 
under the demonstration project.</p>

<p>(5) Hospitals participating in the demonstration 
project shall have or establish robust discharge planning 
programs to ensure that Medicaid beneficiaries 
requiring post-acute care are appropriately placed in, 
or have ready access to, post-acute care settings.</p>

<p>(6) The Secretary and each State selected to 
participate in the demonstration project shall ensure 
that the demonstration project does not result in the 
Medicaid beneficiaries whose care is subject to payment 
under the demonstration project being provided 
with less items and services for which medical 
assistance is provided under the State Medicaid program 
than the items and services for which medical 
assistance would have been provided to such beneficiaries 
under the State Medicaid program in the 
absence of the demonstration project. 
 (C) WAIVER OF PROVISIONS. Notwithstanding section 
1115 (a) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 
1315 (A) ), the Secretary may waive such provisions of titles

such hospital from the application of this 
subsection if the State which is paid under 
such section submits an annual report to 
the Secretary describing how a similar program 
in the State for a participating hospital 
or hospitals achieves or surpasses the 
measured results in terms of patient health 
outcomes and cost savings established 
under this subsection.</p>

<p>(2) MEASURES.  
 (A) IN GENERAL. The Secretary shall

methodology, the Secretary shall provide for an 
assessment (in this subsection referred to as the 
hospital performance score) for each hospital 
for each performance period. 
 (B) APPLICATION. (i)  APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTION.  
The Secretary shall ensure that the application 
of the methodology developed under 
subparagraph (A) results in an appropriate 
distribution of value-based incentive payments 
under paragraph (6) among hospitals 
achieving different levels of hospital 
performance scores, with hospitals achieving 
the highest hospital performance scores receiving the largest value-based incentive 
payments. (ii) HIGHER OF ACHIEVEMENT OR

that the hospital performance score is determined 
using the higher of its achievement 
or improvement score for each measure. (iii) WEIGHTS. The methodology 
developed under subparagraph (A) shall 
provide for the assignment of weights for 
categories of measures as the Secretary determines 
appropriate. (iv) NO MINIMUM PERFORMANCE 
STANDARD. The Secretary shall not set a 
minimum performance standard in determining 
the hospital performance score for 
any hospital. (v) REFLECTION OF MEASURES APPLICABLE 
TO THE HOSPITAL. The hospital 
performance score for a hospital shall 
reflect the measures that apply to the hospital.

that (i)  such percentage is based on 
the hospital performance score of the 
hospital under paragraph (5); and  (II) the total amount of value-
based incentive payments under this 
paragraph to all hospitals in such fiscal 
year is equal to the total amount 
available for value-based incentive 
payments for such fiscal year under

percent (as defined in subparagraph (C)) of the base operating DRG payment 
amount for the discharge for the hospital 
for such fiscal year. The Secretary shall 
make such reductions for all hospitals in 
the fiscal year involved, regardless of 
whether or not the hospital has been determined 
by the Secretary to have earned a 
value-based incentive payment under paragraph (6) for such fiscal year.

individual, including family members 
and other informal caregivers of the 
applicable individual, at the center of the 
care team of the applicable individual. (iii) Whether the model provides for 
in-person contact with applicable individuals. (iv) Whether the model utilizes technology, 
such as electronic health records 
and patient-based remote monitoring systems, 
to coordinate care over time and 
across settings. (v) Whether the model provides for 
the maintenance of a close relationship between 
care coordinators, primary care 
practitioners, specialist physicians, community-
based organizations, and other providers 
of services and suppliers. (vi) Whether the model relies on a 
team-based approach to interventions, such 
as comprehensive care assessments, care 
planning, and self-management coaching.</p>

<p>(vii) Whether, under the model, providers 
of services and suppliers are able to share information with patients, caregivers, 
and other providers of services and suppliers 
on a real time basis.</p>

<p>(3) BUDGET NEUTRALITY.  

 (A) INITIAL PERIOD. The Secretary 
shall not require, as a condition for testing a 
model under paragraph (1), that the design of 
such model ensure that such model is budget 
neutral initially with respect to expenditures 
under the applicable title. 

(B) tERMINATION OR MODIFICATION.  
The Secretary shall terminate or modify the design 
and implementation of a model unless the 
Secretary determines (and the Chief Actuary of 
the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, 
with respect to program spending under the applicable 
title, certifies), after testing has begun, 
that the model is expected to (i)  improve the quality of care (as 
determined by the Administrator of the 
Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) 
without increasing spending under the applicable 
title; 

 (ii) reduce spending under the applicable 
title without reducing the quality of 
care; or (iii) improve the quality of care and 

reduce spending. 
Such termination may occur at any time after 
such testing has begun and before completion of 
the testing.</p>

<p>(4) EVALUATION.  

 (A) IN GENERAL. The Secretary shall 
conduct an evaluation of each model tested 
under this subsection. Such evaluation shall include 
an analysis of  
(i) the quality of care furnished 
under the model, including the measurement 
of patient-level outcomes and patient-
centeredness criteria determined appropriate 
by the Secretary; and  (ii) the changes in spending under 
the applicable titles by reason of the 
model. 
 (B) INFORMATION. The Secretary shall 

make the results of each evaluation under this 
paragraph available to the public in a timely 
fashion and may establish requirements for States and other entities participating in the 
testing of models under this section to collect 
and report information that the Secretary determines 
is necessary to monitor and evaluate 
such models. 

 (C) EXPANSION OF MODELS</p>

<p>(PHASE II). Taking 
into account the evaluation under subsection (b)(4), the 
Secretary may, through rulemaking, expand  (including implementation 
on a nationwide basis) the duration and the 
scope of a model that is being tested under subsection (b) 
or a demonstration project under section 1866C, to the 
extent determined appropriate by the Secretary, if</p>

<p>(1) the Secretary determines that such expansion 
is expected to  
 (A) reduce spending under applicable title 
without reducing the quality of care; or (B) improve the quality of care and reduce 
spending; and  (2) the Chief Actuary of the Centers for Medi


care & Medicaid Services certifies that such expansion 
would reduce program spending under applicable 
titles. (d)  IMPLEMENTATION.</p>

<p>(1) WAIVER AUTHORITY. The Secretary may 
waive such requirements of titles XI and XVIII and of sections 1902(a) (1), 1902 (A) (13), and

a benchmark for each agreement period 
for each ACO using the most recent 
available 3 years of per-beneficiary expenditures 
for parts A and B services for Medicare 
fee-for-service beneficiaries assigned 
to the ACO. Such benchmark shall be adjusted 
for beneficiary characteristics and 
such other factors as the Secretary determines 
appropriate and updated by the projected 
absolute amount of growth in national 
per capita expenditures for parts A 
and B services under the original Medicare 
fee-for-service program, as estimated by the Secretary. Such benchmark shall be 

reset at the start of each agreement pe


riod.</p>

<p>(2) PAYMENTS FOR SHARED SAVINGS. Subject 
to performance with respect to the quality performance 
standards established by the Secretary 
under subsection (b)(3), if an ACO meets the requirements 
under paragraph (1), a percent (as determined 
appropriate by the Secretary) of the difference 
between such estimated average per capita 
Medicare expenditures in a year, adjusted for beneficiary 
characteristics, under the ACO and such 
benchmark for the ACO may be paid to the ACO as 
shared savings and the remainder of such difference 
shall be retained by the program under this title. 
The Secretary shall establish limits on the total 
amount of shared savings that may be paid to an 
ACO under this paragraph.</p>

<p>(3) MONITORING AVOIDANCE OF AT-RISK PA-
TIENTS. If the Secretary determines that an ACO 
has taken steps to avoid patients at risk in order to 
reduce the likelihood of increasing costs to the ACO 
the Secretary may impose an appropriate sanction 
on the ACO, including termination from the program. 


</p>

<p>(4) TERMINATION. The Secretary may terminate 
an agreement with an ACO if it does not meet 
the quality performance standards established by the 
Secretary under subsection (b)(3).

that may be under- or over-valued; (ii) necessary changes to reflect the 
resource use relative to providing home 
health services to low-income Medicare 
beneficiaries or Medicare beneficiaries living 
in medically underserved areas; 
 (iii) ways the outlier payment may be 
improved to more accurately reflect the 
cost of treating Medicare beneficiaries with 
high severity levels of illness; (iv) the role of quality of care incentives 
and penalties in driving provider and 
patient behavior; (v) improvements in the application of 
a wage index; and  (vi) other areas determined appropriate

under the home health prospective payment 
system that may be necessary to set the 
payment rates for home health services based 
on costs of high-quality and efficient home 
health agencies or to improve Medicare beneficiary 
access to care. 
 (d)  A timetable for implementation of any 
appropriate changes based on the analysis of 
the matters described in subparagraphs 
(A), (B), and  (c). 
(E) Other areas determined appropriate by

access to care; 
 (B) variations in service costs for providing 
care to individuals who are dually eligible under 
the Medicare and Medicaid programs; 
 (C) the presence of severe or chronic diseases, 
as evidenced by multiple, discontinuous 
home health episodes; (d)  poverty status, as evidenced by the receipt 
of Supplemental Security Income under 
title XVI of the Social Security Act;(e)the absence of caregivers;(f) language barriers; (g) atypical transportation costs;

(r) ADJUSTMENTS TO MEDICARE DSH PAYMENTS.</p>

<p>(1) EMPIRICALLY JUSTIFIED DSH PAY-
MENTS. For fiscal year 2015 and each subsequent 
fiscal year, instead of the amount of disproportionate 
share hospital payment that would otherwise 
be made under subsection (d) (5)(f) to a subsection (d) hospital for the fiscal year, the Secretary shall 
pay to the subsection (d) hospital 25 percent of such 
amount (which represents the empirically justified 
amount for such payment, as determined by the

<p>(2) ADDITIONAL PAYMENT. In addition to 
the payment made to a subsection (d) hospital under 
paragraph (1), for fiscal year 2015 and each subsequent 
fiscal year, the Secretary shall pay to such 
subsection (d) hospitals an additional amount equal 
to the product of the following factors: 

 (A) FACTOR ONE. A factor equal to the 

difference between (i)  the aggregate amount of pay


ments that would be made to subsection (d) hospitals under subsection (d) (5)(f) if 
this subsection did not apply for such fiscal 
year (as estimated by the Secretary); 
and  (ii) the aggregate amount of payments 
that are made to subsection (d) hospitals

of individuals under the age of 65 who are uninsured, as determined by comparing 
the percent of such individuals (i)  who are uninsured in 2012, 
the last year before coverage expansion 
under the Patient Protection and 
Affordable Care Act (as calculated by 
the Secretary based on the most recent 
estimates available from the Director 
of the Congressional Budget 
Office before a vote in either House 
on such Act that, if determined in the 
affirmative, would clear such Act for 
enrollment); and  (II) who are uninsured in the 
most recent period for which data is 
available (as so calculated). (ii) 2018 AND SUBSEQUENT 

YEARS. For fiscal year 2018 and each 
subsequent fiscal year, a factor equal to 1 
minus the percent change</p>

<p>(divided by 100)

as determined by comparing the 
percent of individuals (i)  who are uninsured in 2012 
(as estimated by the Secretary, based on data from the Census Bureau or 
other sources the Secretary determines 
appropriate, and certified by 
the Chief Actuary of the Centers for 
Medicare & Medicaid Services); and  (II) who are uninsured in the 
most recent period for which data is 
available (as so estimated and certified). 


 (C) FACTOR THREE. A factor equal to 

the percent, for each subsection (d) hospital, 

that represents the quotient of  
(i) the amount of uncompensated 
care for such hospital for a period selected 
by the Secretary (as estimated by the Secretary, 
based on appropriate data (including, 
in the case where the Secretary determines 
that alternative data is available 
which is a better proxy for the costs of 
subsection (d) hospitals for treating the 
uninsured, the use of such alternative 
data)); and  (ii) the aggregate amount of uncompensated 
care for all subsection (d) hospitals 
that receive a payment under this subsection for such period (as so estimated, 
based on such data).</p>

no administrative or judicial review under section 

1869, section 1878, or otherwise of the following:

 (A) BOARD.</p>

<p>(1) IN GENERAL. Title XVIII of the Social Security 
Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.), as amended by 
section 3022, is amended by adding at the end the 
following new section: 

INDEPENDENT MEDICARE ADVISORY BOARD 

<h3>SEC. 1899A. </h3> (A) ESTABLISHMENT. There is established 
an independent board to be known as the Independent 
Medicare Advisory Board. 

 (B) PURPOSE. It is the purpose of this section to, 
in accordance with the following provisions of this section, 
reduce the per capita rate of growth in Medicare spending</p>

<p>(1) by requiring the Chief Actuary of the Centers 
for Medicare & Medicaid Services to determine 
in each year to which this section applies (in this 
section referred to as a determination year) the 
projected per capita growth rate under Medicare for 
the second year following the determination year (in 
this section referred to as an implementation year);</p>

<p>(2) if the projection for the implementation 
year exceeds the target growth rate for that year, by 
requiring the Board to develop and submit during 
the first year following the determination year (in 
this section referred to as a proposal year) a proposal 
containing recommendations to reduce the 
Medicare per capita growth rate to the extent required 
by this section; and 

</p>

<p>(3) by requiring the Secretary to implement 

such proposals unless Congress enacts legislation 

pursuant to this section. 

 (C) BOARD PROPOSALS.</p>

<p>(1) DEVELOPMENT.  
 (A) IN GENERAL. The Board shall develop 
detailed and specific proposals related to 
the Medicare program in accordance with the 
succeeding provisions of this section. 
 (B) ADVISORY REPORTS. Beginning 
January 15, 2014, the Board may develop and 
submit to Congress advisory reports on matters 
related to the Medicare program, regardless of 
whether or not the Board submitted a proposal 
for such year. Such a report may, for years 
prior to 2020, include recommendations regarding 
improvements to payment systems for providers 
of services and suppliers who are not otherwise 
subject to the scope of the Boards recommendations 
in a proposal under this section. 
Any advisory report submitted under this subparagraph 
shall not be subject to the rules for 
congressional consideration under subsection (d). 
(2) PROPOSALS.   (A) REQUIREMENTS. Each proposal 

submitted under this section in a proposal year 

shall meet each of the following requirements: (i)  If the Chief Actuary of the Centers 
for Medicare & Medicaid Services has 
made a determination under paragraph (7) (A) in the determination year, the proposal 
shall include recommendations so 
that the proposal as a whole</p>

<p>(after taking 
into account recommendations under 
clause (v)) will result in a net reduction in 
total Medicare program spending in the 
implementation year that is at least equal 
to the applicable savings target established 
under paragraph (7) (B) for such implementation 
year. In determining whether a 
proposal meets the requirement of the preceding 
sentence, reductions in Medicare 
program spending during the 3-month period 
immediately preceding the implementation 
year shall be counted to the extent 
that such reductions are a result of the implementation 
of recommendations contained 
in the proposal for a change in the 
payment rate for an item or service that was effective during such period pursuant 
to subsection  (e)(2) (A) . (ii) The proposal shall not include 
any recommendation to ration health care, 
raise revenues or Medicare beneficiary premiums 
under section 1818, 1818A, or 
1839, increase Medicare beneficiary cost-
sharing (including deductibles, coinsurance, 
and copayments), or otherwise restrict 
benefits or modify eligibility criteria. (iii) In the case of proposals submitted 
prior to December 31, 2018, the 
proposal shall not include any recommendation 
that would reduce payment 
rates for items and services furnished, 
prior to December 31, 2019, by providers 
of services (as defined in section 1861 (u)) 
and suppliers (as defined in section 
1861 (d) ) scheduled, pursuant to the 
amendments made by section 3401 of the 
Patient Protection and Affordable Care 
Act, to receive a reduction to the inflationary 
payment updates of such providers 
of services and suppliers in excess of a reduction 
due to productivity in a year in which such recommendations would take 
effect. (iv) As appropriate, the proposal 
shall include recommendations to reduce 
Medicare payments under parts C and D, 
such as reductions in direct subsidy payments 
to Medicare Advantage and prescription 
drug plans specified under paragraph (1) and  (2) of section 1860D15 (A) that are related to administrative expenses 
(including profits) for basic coverage, denying 
high bids or removing high bids for 
prescription drug coverage from the calculation 
of the national average monthly 
bid amount under section 1860D13 (A) (4), 
and reductions in payments to Medicare 
Advantage plans under clauses (i)  and  (ii) 
of section 1853(a) (1) (B) that are related 
to administrative expenses (including profits) 
and performance bonuses for Medicare 
Advantage plans under section 1853 (n). 
Any such recommendation shall not affect 
the base beneficiary premium percentage 
specified under 1860D13 (A) . 

 (v) The proposal shall include recommendations 
with respect to administrative 
funding for the Secretary to carry out 
the recommendations contained in the proposal. (vi) The proposal shall only include 
recommendations related to the Medicare 
program. 
 (B) ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS. In 

developing and submitting each proposal under 
this section in a proposal year, the Board shall, 
to the extent feasible (i)  give priority to recommendations 
that extend Medicare solvency; (ii) include recommendations that (i)  improve the health care delivery 
system and health outcomes, including 
by promoting integrated care, 
care coordination, prevention and 
wellness, and quality and efficiency 
improvement; and  (II) protect and improve Medicare 
beneficiaries access to necessary 
and evidence-based items and services, 
including in rural and frontier areas; 

 (iii) include recommendations that 
target reductions in Medicare program 
spending to sources of excess cost growth; (iv) consider the effects on Medicare 
beneficiaries of changes in payments to 
providers of services (as defined in section 
1861 (u)) and suppliers (as defined in section 
1861 (d) ); (v) consider the effects of the recommendations 
on providers of services and 
suppliers with actual or projected negative 
cost margins or payment updates; and  (vi) consider the unique needs of 
Medicare beneficiaries who are dually eligible 
for Medicare and the Medicaid program 
under title XIX. 
 (C) NO INCREASE IN TOTAL MEDICARE 

PROGRAM SPENDING. Each proposal submitted 
under this section shall be designed in such a 
manner that implementation of the recommendations 
contained in the proposal would 
not be expected to result, over the 10-year period 
starting with the implementation year, in 
any increase in the total amount of net Medicare 
program spending relative to the total amount of net Medicare program spending that 
would have occurred absent such implementation. (d)  CONSULTATION WITH MEDPAC. The 
Board shall submit a draft copy of each proposal 
to be submitted under this section to the

<p>(8) DISTRIBUTION OF ADDITIONAL RESIDENCY 
POSITIONS.  
 (A) REDUCTIONS IN LIMIT BASED ON UNUSED 
POSITIONS. (i)  IN GENERAL. Except as provided 
in clause (ii), if a hospitals reference 
resident level (as defined in subparagraph (H) (i) ) is less than the otherwise applicable 
resident limit (as defined in subparagraph (H) (iii)), effective for portions of 
cost reporting periods occurring on or after 
July 1, 2011, the otherwise applicable resident 
limit shall be reduced by 65 percent 
of the difference between such otherwise 



applicable resident limit and such reference 

resident level. (ii) EXCEPTIONS. This subpara


graph shall not apply to (i)  a hospital located in a rural 
area (as defined in subsection (d) (2) (d) (ii)) with fewer than 250 
acute care inpatient beds; (ii) a hospital that was part of 
a qualifying entity which had a voluntary 
residency reduction plan approved 
under paragraph (6) (B) or 
under the authority of section 402 of 
Public Law 90248, if the hospital 
demonstrates to the Secretary that it 
has a specified plan in place for filling 
the unused positions by not later than 
2 years after the date of enactment of 
this paragraph; or (III) a hospital described in 
paragraph (4) (H) (v). 
 (B) DISTRIBUTION. (i)  IN GENERAL. The Secretary 

shall increase the otherwise applicable resi


dent limit for each qualifying hospital that 




submits an application under this subparagraph 
by such number as the Secretary 
may approve for portions of cost reporting 
periods occurring on or after July 1, 2011. 
The aggregate number of increases in the 
otherwise applicable resident limit under 
this subparagraph shall be equal to the aggregate 
reduction in such limits attributable 
to subparagraph (a) (as estimated 
by the Secretary). (ii) REQUIREMENTS. Subject to 
clause (iii), a hospital that receives an increase 
in the otherwise applicable resident 
limit under this subparagraph shall ensure, 
during the 5-year period beginning on the 
date of such increase, that (i)  the number of full-time 
equivalent primary care residents, as 
defined in paragraph (5) (h) (as determined 
by the Secretary), excluding 
any additional positions under sub-
clause (II), is not less than the average 
number of full-time equivalent 
primary care residents (as so determined) 
during the 3 most recent cost reporting periods ending prior to the 
date of enactment of this paragraph; 
and  (II) not less than 75 percent of 
the positions attributable to such increase 
are in a primary care or general 
surgery residency (as determined 
by the Secretary). 

The Secretary may determine whether a 
hospital has met the requirements under 
this clause during such 5-year period in 
such manner and at such time as the Secretary 
determines appropriate, including at 
the end of such 5-year period. (iii) REDISTRIBUTION OF POSITIONS 
IF HOSPITAL NO LONGER MEETS CERTAIN 
REQUIREMENTS. In the case where the 
Secretary determines that a hospital described 
in clause (ii) does not meet either 
of the requirements under subclause (I) or (II) of such clause, the Secretary shall (i)  reduce the otherwise applicable 
resident limit of the hospital by 
the amount by which such limit was 
increased under this paragraph; and 

 (ii) provide for the distribution 
of positions attributable to such reduction 
in accordance with the requirements 
of this paragraph. 

 (C) CONSIDERATIONS IN REDISTRIBU-
TION. In determining for which hospitals the 
increase in the otherwise applicable resident 
limit is provided under subparagraph (B), the 
Secretary shall take into account (i)  the demonstration likelihood of 
the hospital filling the positions made 
available under this paragraph within the 
first 3 cost reporting periods beginning on 
or after July 1, 2011, as determined by 
the Secretary; and  (ii) whether the hospital has an accredited 
rural training track (as described 
in paragraph (4) (h) (iv)). (d)  PRIORITY FOR CERTAIN AREAS. In 

determining for which hospitals the increase in 
the otherwise applicable resident limit is provided 
under subparagraph (B), subject to subparagraph (E), the Secretary shall distribute 
the increase to hospitals based on the following 
factors: 

 (i)  Whether the hospital is located in 
a State with a resident-to-population ratio 
in the lowest quartile (as determined by 
the Secretary). (ii) Whether the hospital is located 
in a State, a territory of the United States, 
or the District of Columbia that is among 
the top 10 States, territories, or Districts 
in terms of the ratio of  
(I) the total population of the 
State, territory, or District living in 
an area designated (under such section 
332(a) (1) (A)) as a health professional 
shortage area (as of the date of 
enactment of this paragraph); to (ii) the total population of the 
State, territory, or District (as determined 
by the Secretary based on the 
most recent available population data 
published by the Bureau of the Census). (iii) Whether the hospital is located 

in a rural area (as defined in subsection (d) (2) (d) (ii)). 

(e)RESERVATION OF POSITIONS FOR 
CERTAIN HOSPITALS. (i)  IN GENERAL. Subject to clause (ii), the Secretary shall reserve the positions 
available for distribution under this 
paragraph as follows: (i)  70 percent of such positions 
for distribution to hospitals described 
in clause (i) of subparagraph (d). 
(II) 30 percent of such positions 
for distribution to hospitals described 
in clause (ii) and  (iii) of such subparagraph. (ii) EXCEPTION IF POSITIONS NOT 

REDISTRIBUTED BY JULY 1, 2011. In the 
case where the Secretary does not distribute 
positions to hospitals in accordance 
with clause (i) by July 1, 2011, the Secretary 
shall distribute such positions to 
other hospitals in accordance with the considerations 
described in subparagraph (C) 
and the priority described in subparagraph (D). 

(f) LIMITATION. A hospital may not receive 
more than 75 full-time equivalent additional 
residency positions under this paragraph. (g) APPLICATION OF PER RESIDENT 
AMOUNTS FOR PRIMARY CARE AND NONPRIMARY 
CARE. With respect to additional residency 
positions in a hospital attributable to the 
increase provided under this paragraph, the approved 
FTE per resident amounts are deemed 
to be equal to the hospital per resident amounts 
for primary care and nonprimary care computed 
under paragraph (2) (d)  for that hospital. (h) DEFINITIONS. In this paragraph: (i)  REFERENCE RESIDENT LEVEL.  
The term reference resident level means, 
with respect to a hospital, the highest resident 
level for any of the 3 most recent cost 
reporting periods</p>

<p>(ending before the date 
of the enactment of this paragraph) of the 
hospital for which a cost report has been 
settled (or, if not, submitted</p>

<p>(subject to 
audit)), as determined by the Secretary. (ii) RESIDENT LEVEL. The term 
resident level has the meaning given such 
term in paragraph (7) (C) (i). 

 (iii) OTHERWISE APPLICABLE RESIDENT 
LIMIT. The term otherwise applicable 
resident limit means, with respect to 
a hospital, the limit otherwise applicable 
under subparagraphs 
(F) (i)  and  (H) of 
paragraph (4) on the resident level for the 
hospital determined without regard to this 
paragraph but taking into account paragraph (7) (A) ..

prints on file with the State law enforcement 
department, the department will immediately 
inform the State and the State will immediately 
 inform the long-term care facility or provider 
which employs the direct patient access employee 
of such conviction; and  (C) require that criminal history background 
checks conducted under the nationwide 
program remain valid for a period of time specified 
by the Secretary.</p>

LIMITATIONS ON CERTAIN USES OF COMPARATIVE 
CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS RESEARCH 

<h3>SEC. 1182. </h3> (A) The Secretary may only use evidence 
and findings from research conducted under section 1181 
to make a determination regarding coverage under title 
XVIII if such use is through an iterative and transparent 
process which includes public comment and considers the 
effect on subpopulations. 

 (B) Nothing in section 1181 shall be construed as  1685</p>

items or services under title XVIII that the Secretary 
determines are reasonable and necessary 
under section 1862 (l) (1); or (2) authorizing the Secretary to deny coverage 
of items or services under such title solely on the 
basis of comparative clinical effectiveness research. 
 (C) (1) The Secretary shall not use evidence or find


ings from comparative clinical effectiveness research conducted 
under section 1181 in determining coverage, reimbursement, 
or incentive programs under title XVIII in a 
manner that treats extending the life of an elderly, disabled, 
or terminally ill individual as of lower value than 
extending the life of an individual who is younger, non-
disabled, or not terminally ill.</p>

<p>(2) Para(1) shall not be construed as preventing 
the Secretary from using evidence or findings from 
such comparative clinical effectiveness research in determining 
coverage, reimbursement, or incentive programs 
under title XVIII based upon a comparison of the difference 
in the effectiveness of alternative treatments in extending 
an individuals life due to the individuals age, disability, 
or terminal illness. (d)  (1) The Secretary shall not use evidence or findings 
from comparative clinical effectiveness research con


 ducted under section 1181 in determining coverage, reimbursement, 
or incentive programs under title XVIII in a 
manner that precludes, or with the intent to discourage, 
an individual from choosing a health care treatment based 
on how the individual values the tradeoff between extending 
the length of their life and the risk of disability.</p>

<p>(2) (A) Para(1) shall not be construed to (i)  limit the application of differential copayments 
under title XVIII based on factors such as 
cost or type of service; or (ii) prevent the Secretary from using evidence 
or findings from such comparative clinical effectiveness 
research in determining coverage, reimbursement, 
or incentive programs under such title based 
upon a comparison of the difference in the effectiveness 
of alternative health care treatments in extending 
an individuals life due to that individuals age, 
disability, or terminal illness.</p>

<p>(3) Nothing in the provisions of, or amendments 

made by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, 
shall be construed to limit comparative clinical effectiveness 
research or any other research, evaluation, or dissemination 
of information concerning the likelihood that 
a health care treatment will result in disability. 1687(e)The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute 
established under section 1181(b)(1) shall not develop 
or employ a dollars-per-quality adjusted life year (or similar 
measure that discounts the value of a life because of 
an individuals disability) as a threshold to establish what 
type of health care is cost effective or recommended. The 
Secretary shall not utilize such an adjusted life year (or 
such a similar measure) as a threshold to determine coverage, 
reimbursement, or incentive programs under title 
XVIII.. (d)  IN GENERAL. Part D of title XI of the Social 
Security Act, as added by subsection (a) and amended by 
subsection (c), is amended by adding at the end the following

OR INTERCHANGEABLE.  

</p>

<p>(1) IN GENERAL. Any person may submit an 

application for licensure of a biological product 

under this subsection.</p>

<p>(2) CONTENT.  
 (A) IN GENERAL. (i)  REQUIRED INFORMATION. An 
application submitted under this subsection 
shall include information demonstrating 
that (i)  the biological product is biosimilar 
to a reference product based 
upon data derived from (aa) analytical studies that 
demonstrate that the biological 
product is highly similar to the 
reference product notwithstanding 
minor differences in 
clinically inactive components;(bb) animal studies (including 
the assessment of toxicity); 
and  (cc) a clinical study or 
studies (including the assessment 
of immunogenicity and pharmacokinetics 
or pharmacodynamics) that are sufficient 
to demonstrate safety, purity, 
and potency in 1 or more 
appropriate conditions of use for 
which the reference product is licensed 
and intended to be used 
and for which licensure is sought 
for the biological product; (ii) the biological product and 

reference product utilize the same 
mechanism or mechanisms of action 
for the condition or conditions of use 
prescribed, recommended, or suggested 
in the proposed labeling, but 
only to the extent the mechanism or 
mechanisms of action are known for 
the reference product; (iii) the condition or conditions 
of use prescribed, recommended, or 
suggested in the labeling proposed for 
the biological product have been previously 
approved for the reference 
product; (iv) the route of administration, 
the dosage form, and the strength of the biological product are 
the same as those of the reference 
product; and  (V) the facility in which the biological 
product is manufactured, processed, 
packed, or held meets standards 
designed to assure that the biological 
product continues to be safe, 
pure, and potent. (ii) DETERMINATION BY SEC-

RETARY. The Secretary may determine, 
in the Secretarys discretion, that an element 
described in clause (i) (i)  is unnecessary 
in an application submitted under this 
subsection. (iii) ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  
An application submitted under this subsection (I) shall include publicly-available 
information regarding the Secretarys 
previous determination that 
the reference product is safe, pure, 
and potent; and  (II) may include any additional 
information in support of the application, including publicly-available information 
with respect to the reference 
product or another biological product. 

 (B) INTERCHANGEABILITY. An application 
(or a supplement to an application) submitted 
under this subsection may include information 
demonstrating that the biological product 
meets the standards described in paragraph (4).</p>

<p>(3) EVALUATION BY SECRETARY. Upon re


view of an application (or a supplement to an appli


cation) submitted under this subsection, the Sec


retary shall license the biological product under this 

subsection if  
 (A) the Secretary determines that the information 
submitted in the application (or the 
supplement) is sufficient to show that the biological 
product (i)  is biosimilar to the reference 
product; or (ii) meets the standards described in 
paragraph (4), and therefore is interchangeable 
with the reference product; and  (B) the applicant (or other appropriate 
person) consents to the inspection of the facility that is the subject of the application, in accordance 
with subsection (c). 
(4) SAFETY STANDARDS FOR DETERMINING 

INTERCHANGEABILITY. Upon review of an application 
submitted under this subsection or any supplement 
to such application, the Secretary shall determine 
the biological product to be interchangeable 
with the reference product if the Secretary determines 
that the information submitted in the application 
(or a supplement to such application) is sufficient 
to show that  

 (A) the biological product (i)  is biosimilar to the reference 
product; and  (ii) can be expected to produce the 
same clinical result as the reference product 
in any given patient; and  (B) for a biological product that is ad


ministered more than once to an individual, the 
risk in terms of safety or diminished efficacy of 
alternating or switching between use of the biological

information received under this paragraph, provided 
that if the reference product sponsor opts 
to destroy such information, it will confirm destruction 
in writing to the subsection (k) applicant. (g) RULE OF CONSTRUCTION. Nothing 
in this paragraph shall be construed  

 (i)  as an admission by the subsection (k) applicant regarding the validity, enforceability, 
or infringement of any patent; 
or (ii) as an agreement or admission by 
the subsection (k) applicant with respect to 
the competency, relevance, or materiality 
of any confidential information. (h) EFFECT OF VIOLATION. The disclo


sure of any confidential information in violation 
of this paragraph shall be deemed to cause the 
subsection (k) applicant to suffer irreparable 
harm for which there is no adequate legal remedy 
and the court shall consider immediate injunctive 
relief to be an appropriate and necessary 
remedy for any violation or threatened 
violation of this paragraph.</p>

<h3>SEC. 3203. CLASS INDEPENDENCE BENEFIT PLAN. 
</h3>
<p>
 (A) PROCESS FOR DEVELOPMENT.</p>

<p>(1) IN GENERAL. The Secretary, in consultation 
with appropriate actuaries and other experts, 
shall develop at least 3 actuarially sound benefit 
plans as alternatives for consideration for designation 
by the Secretary as the CLASS Independence 
Benefit Plan under which eligible beneficiaries shall 
receive benefits under this title. Each of the plan alternatives 
developed shall be designed to provide eligible 
beneficiaries with the benefits described in section 
3205 consistent with the following requirements: 


 (A) PREMIUMS. (i)  IN GENERAL. Beginning with 

the first year of the CLASS program, and 

for each year thereafter, subject to clauses (ii) and  (iii), the Secretary shall establish 
all premiums to be paid by enrollees for 
the year based on an actuarial analysis of 
the 75-year costs of the program that en

sures solvency throughout such 75-year period. (ii) NOMINAL PREMIUM FOR POOR


EST INDIVIDUALS AND FULL-TIME STU


DENTS. (i)  IN GENERAL. The monthly 
premium for enrollment in the 
CLASS program shall not exceed the 
applicable dollar amount per month 
determined under subclause (II) for  (aa) any individual whose 
income does not exceed the poverty 
line; and  (bb) any individual who 
has not attained age 22, and is 
actively employed during any period 
in which the individual is a 
full-time student (as determined 
by the Secretary). (ii) APPLICABLE DOLLAR 
AMOUNT. The applicable dollar 
amount described in this subclause is 
the amount equal to $5, increased by 
the percentage increase in the consumer 
price index for all urban consumers (U.S. city average) for each 
year occurring after 2009 and before 
such year. (iii) CLASS INDEPENDENCE FUND 

RESERVES. At such time as the CLASS 
program has been in operation for 10 
years, the Secretary shall establish all premiums 
to be paid by enrollees for the year 
based on an actuarial analysis that accumulated 
reserves in the CLASS Independence 
Fund would not decrease in that year. 
At such time as the Secretary determines 
the CLASS program demonstrates a sustained 
ability to finance expected yearly expenses 
with expected yearly premiums and 
interest credited to the CLASS Independence 
Fund, the Secretary may decrease the 
required amount of CLASS Independence 
Fund reserves. 
 (B) VESTING PERIOD. A 5-year vesting 

period for eligibility for benefits. 
 (C) BENEFIT TRIGGERS. A benefit trig


ger for provision of benefits that requires a de


termination that an individual has a functional 

limitation, as certified by a licensed health care practitioner, described in any of the following 

clauses that is expected to last for a continuous 

period of more than 90 days: (i)  The individual is determined to 
be unable to perform at least the minimum 
number (which may be 2 or 3) of activities 
of daily living as are required under the 
plan for the provision of benefits without 
substantial assistance (as defined by the 
Secretary) from another individual. (ii) The individual requires substantial 
supervision to protect the individual 
from threats to health and safety due to 
substantial cognitive impairment. (iii) The individual has a level of 
functional limitation similar (as determined 
under regulations prescribed by the Secretary) 
to the level of functional limitation 
described in clause (i) or (ii). (d)  CASH BENEFIT. Payment of a cash 

benefit that satisfies the following requirements: (i)  MINIMUM REQUIRED AMOUNT.  
The benefit amount provides an eligible 
beneficiary with not less than an average 
of $50 per day (as determined based on the reasonably expected distribution of 
beneficiaries receiving benefits at various 
benefit levels). (ii) AMOUNT SCALED TO FUNCTIONAL 
ABILITY. The benefit amount is 
varied based on a scale of functional ability, 
with not less than 2, and not more 
than 6, benefit level amounts. (iii) DAILY OR WEEKLY. The benefit 
is paid on a daily or weekly basis. (iv) NO LIFETIME OR AGGREGATE 
LIMIT. The benefit is not subject to any 
lifetime or aggregate limit.(e)COORDINATION WITH SUPPLE


MENTAL COVERAGE OBTAINED THROUGH THE 
EXCHANGE. The benefits allow for coordination 
with any supplemental coverage purchased 
through an Exchange established under section 
1311 of the Patient Protection and Affordable 
Care Act.</p>

<p>(2) REVIEW AND RECOMMENDATION BY THE 

CLASS INDEPENDENCE ADVISORY COUNCIL. The 
CLASS Independence Advisory Council shall  
 (A) evaluate the alternative benefit plans 
developed under paragraph (1); and  (B) recommend for designation as the 
CLASS Independence Benefit Plan for offering 
to the public the plan that the Council determines 
best balances price and benefits to meet 
enrollees needs in an actuarially sound manner, 
while optimizing the probability of the long-
term sustainability of the CLASS program.</p>

<p>(3) DESIGNATION BY THE SECRETARY. Not 

later than October 1, 2012, the Secretary, taking 
into consideration the recommendation of the 
CLASS Independence Advisory Council under paragraph (2)(b), shall designate a benefit plan as the 
CLASS Independence Benefit Plan. The Secretary 
shall publish such designation, along with details of 
the plan and the reasons for the selection by the 
Secretary, in a final rule that allows for a period of 
public comment. 
 (B) ADDITIONAL PREMIUM REQUIREMENTS.</p>

<p>(1) ADJUSTMENT OF PREMIUMS.  

 (A) IN GENERAL. Except as provided in 
subparagraphs 
(B), (C), (D), and (E), the 
amount of the monthly premium determined for 
an individual upon such individuals enrollment 
in the CLASS program shall remain the same for as long as the individual is an active en


rollee in the program. 
 (B) RECALCULATED PREMIUM IF RE


QUIRED FOR PROGRAM SOLVENCY. (i)  IN GENERAL. Subject to clause (ii), if the Secretary determines, based on 
the most recent report of the Board of 
Trustees of the CLASS Independence

Advisory Council, and the annual report 
of the Inspector General of the Department 
of Health and Human Services, 
and waste, fraud, and abuse, or such other 
information as the Secretary determines 
appropriate, that the monthly premiums 
and income to the CLASS Independence 
Fund for a year are projected to be insufficient 
with respect to the 20-year period 
that begins with that year, the Secretary 
shall adjust the monthly premiums for individuals 
enrolled in the CLASS program 
as necessary (but maintaining a nominal 
premium for enrollees whose income is 
below the poverty line or who are full-time 
students actively employed). 

 (ii) EXEMPTION FROM INCREASE.  
Any increase in a monthly premium imposed 
as result of a determination described 
in clause (i) shall not apply with 
respect to the monthly premium of any active 
enrollee who (i)  has attained age 65; (ii) has paid premiums for enrollment 
in the program for at least 
20 years; and  (III) is not actively employed. 

 (C) RECALCULATED PREMIUM IF RE


ENROLLMENT AFTER MORE THAN A 3-MONTH 

LAPSE. (i)  IN GENERAL. The reenrollment 
of an individual after a 90-day period during 
which the individual failed to pay the 
monthly premium required to maintain the 
individuals enrollment in the CLASS program 
shall be treated as an initial enrollment 
for purposes of age-adjusting the 
premium for enrollment in the program. (ii) CREDIT FOR PRIOR MONTHS IF 
REENROLLED WITHIN 5 YEARS. An individual 
who reenrolls in the CLASS program after such a 90-day period and before 
the end of the 5-year period that begins 
with the first month for which the individual 
failed to pay the monthly premium 
required to maintain the individuals enrollment 
in the program shall be (i)  credited with any months of 
paid premiums that accrued prior to 
the individuals lapse in enrollment; 
and  (II) notwithstanding the total 
amount of any such credited months, 
required to satisfy section 
3202</p><p>(6) (A) (ii) before being eligible to 
receive benefits. (d)  NO LONGER STATUS AS A FULL-TIME 
STUDENT. An individual subject to a nominal 
premium on the basis of being described in subsection (a) (1) (A) (ii) (i) (bb) who ceases to be described 
in that subsection, beginning with the 
first month following the month in which the 
individual ceases to be so described, shall be 
subject to the same monthly premium as the 
monthly premium that applies to an individual 
of the same age who first enrolls in the program under the most similar circumstances as 
the individual (such as the first year of eligibility 
for enrollment in the program or in a subsequent 
year).(e)PENALTY FOR REENOLLMENT AFTER 
5-YEAR LAPSE. In the case of an individual 
who reenrolls in the CLASS program after the 
end of the 5-year period described in subparagraph (c) (ii), the monthly premium required 
for the individual shall be the age-adjusted premium 
that would be applicable to an initially 
enrolling individual who is the same age as the 
reenrolling individual, increased by the greater 
of  
(i) an amount that the Secretary determines 
is actuarially sound for each 
month that occurs during the period that 
begins with the first month for which the 
individual failed to pay the monthly premium 
required to maintain the individuals 
enrollment in the CLASS program and 
ends with the month preceding the month 
in which the reenollment is effective; or 

 (ii) 1 percent of the applicable age-

adjusted premium for each such month oc


curring in such period.</p>

<p>(2) ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. In determining 
the monthly premiums for the CLASS program 
the Secretary may factor in costs for administering 
the program, not to exceed for any year in 
which the program is in effect under this title, an 
amount equal to 3 percent of all premiums paid during 
the year.</p>

<p>(3) NO UNDERWRITING REQUIREMENTS. No 
underwriting (other than on the basis of age in accordance 
with subparagraphs 
(D) and  (E) of paragraph (1)) shall be used to  

 (A) determine the monthly premium for 
enrollment in the CLASS program; or (B) prevent an individual from enrolling 
in the program. 
 (C) SELF-ATTESTATION AND VERIFICATION OF IN-
COME. The Secretary shall establish procedures to</p>

does not exceed the poverty line or that their status as a full-time student who is actively employed;</p>

<p>(2) verify, using procedures similar to the procedures 
used by the Commissioner of Social Security 
under section 1631 (e)(1) (B) (ii) of the Social Security 
Act and consistent with the requirements applicable 
to the conveyance of data and information 
under section 1942 of such Act, the validity of such

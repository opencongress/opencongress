      <p class="behave">OC editors: No bills at this time. The Congressional Research Service -- the official non-partisan think tank for Congress -- has not tagged any bills in the current <%= Settings.default_congress %>th session of Congress with this subject area. However, this subject area has been applied to at least one bill in previous sessions of Congress (<%= link_to 'See bills', :controller => 'issue', :action => 'defunct', :id => @subject %>).</p>

There are over 4,000 individual issue areas maintained by CRS, some of which are closely related -- for example, "environmental health", "environmental justice", "environmental law enforcement", etc.</p>

      <p class="behave">The CRS might yet tag bills with this issue area in the current session of Congress, but the likelihood of this for any given issue cannot be reliably predicted from the available data. In the future, we seek to work with Congress and other invested parties in order to open up the CRS process and help make their work more accessible in accordance with the 8 Principles of Open Government Data. OpenCongress currently displays 4,795 total subject areas from CRS that have been applied to at least one bill in the past three Congresses. Our legislative data partner GovTrack contains 6,805 subject areas going back to the 103rd U.S. Congress.</p>
